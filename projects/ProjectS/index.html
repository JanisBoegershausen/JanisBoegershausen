			Goals<br>
			<div style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px">
				I have the following goals for this project:<br>
				- Create an open-world RPG. 52<br>
				- Give it an interesting and complex magic system. Magic should feel like something complex that can be explored.<br>
				- Have immersive and diverse crafting systems. Item quality will depend on both character experience and player skills.<br>
				- Design a rich and interesting world, with a lot of content to be discovered. To make this possible, the map will obviously not be that big.<br>
				- Allow the player to build and manage a town/castle, where the player can give NPCs tasks, collect taxes and gain a growing influence over the area.

			Grass Performance Test</br>
			<div style="font-size: 15px; color: gray;">24.03.2021</div>
			<div style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px; float:left">
				Today I worked on grass performance. I love the dense foliage in kingdom come deliverance, so I would love to achieve something similar. 
				The results of today are quite promising, but I must do some more testing in actual scenes.

			<div>How to?</div>
			<div style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px">
				<div style="font-size: 25px; margin-top: 10px">LODs</div>
				The most important thing I did was using LODs, so that a different grass mesh is shown, based on the distance to the camera. 
				One grass mesh for me is 16 patches of grass. <br>
				On the high detail LODs, each patch has 4 Faces, rotated each by 45 degrees. 
				This way it looks like more and not just a single plain. The further away from the camera, the mesh is, 
				the fewer sides each patch has and at max distance, before it becomes completely invisible, each patch only consists of a single face.
				<br>

				<br>
				<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LevelOfDetail.html" style="color: lightblue">"Level of Detail (LOD) for meshes" in the Unity Documentation</a>
				<br>
				<div style="font-size: 25px; margin-top: 10px">Triangles</div>
				Another thing I did was not using quads to render each patch. Instead, I use a single triangle with different UVs, which allows me to basically half
				the amount of rendered triangles. It is important to set the repeating mode on the grass texture to clamp, to avoid bugs.
				<br>
				<img style="height:400px; width:auto" src="Assets/Grass Test/uvExample.PNG">
				<div style="font-size: 25px; margin-top: 10px">Vertex Displacement For Variety</div>
				To avoid any patterns in the grass from placing them down, I added a random vertex displacement based on the position of the object. 
				That way, every cluster of grass is slightly different, without me having to change anything manually. 
				(I just added the output of a gradient noise, that was sampled based on the world position, to the vertex position in the shader)
